<h1>Deepika Yerragunta.</h1>

<div id="bio">

  <p>Hi! I am a product gal interested in all things technology. I've spent 12 years of my career building products for  really big (Intel), small (Marketron), really tiny (Hautely) companies. My big interests are IoT, B2B software, e-commerce and the future of India. I love breaking things and improving them for the better. <p>I am a tech nerd with a CS background (Masters@UC Davis and Bachelors@Osmania University).</p>

  <p> I loved a quote I heard recently - “Innovation happens at the edges and at the intersections”. I live on the intersection and love to see how technology disrupts the status quo in every field. I am really really thankful that we live in this decade of tech, post the smart phone and social networking era, where great ideas and minds are able to connect easily with each other.</p>

  <p>My master's thesis on “Wireless sensor networking protocols” brought me to Intel where I was hired as the youngest engineer in its strategic consulting practice. </p>

  <p>I am currently an MBA candidate at the Wharton School where I have gotten to learn some cool things about finance, investing and monetization and got to meet really great people.</p>

  <p>Would love to hear from you, write to me directly at 
   <a href="mailto:yrdeepika@gmail.com">yrdeepika@gmail.com</a> or follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/yrdeepika">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://medium.com/@yrdeepika">Medium</a>.</p>
